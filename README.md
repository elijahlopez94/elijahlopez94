## Projects:
<!-- #### [Depression Survey Analysis](https://github.com/elijahlopez94/depression_survey_analysis)
Data Scientist

Identified key demographic and lifestyle factors contributing to depression risk, enabling medical professionals to improve diagnostic accuracy and provide holistic care recommendations.

* Analyzed survey responses from 2,500+ adults to uncover statistically significant depression risk factors.
* Preprocessed data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and applying feature engineering.
* Conducted statistical tests to compare at-risk and non-risk groups, highlighting key behavioral differences.
* Developed a logistic regression model with 97% recall, prioritizing false negative reduction for early detection.
